      <h2>Potty Training~!</h2>

      <p> Hello Moms~! <br>
            It is time for the dreaded potty training. It means accidents will happen and poop will be in places where you do not want to find it. <br>
            My three year old, doesn't seem to care that there is poop or pee in his underwear and assumes that mommy and daddy will always clean <br>
            it up for him.
            </p>
