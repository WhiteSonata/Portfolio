    1)Readings <br>
     How do I use the sandbox!? I asked my classmates and they didn't know either. <br>

     Aha, I figured it out. So you need to click the + button and Browser. 
    They really couldn't have placed that explanation in the notes? <br>

    I think how they structured their example within Ch.4 was odd but maybe I need to read a different chapter to understand. <br> <br>
    
    Any major differences between var and let? <br>

    I read the above, and the first example makes perfect sense. Code #2 doesnt make as much sense, so var works but let doesnt? <br><br>
    

    2)Activity  <br>
       Austin created the document and we went over it using Zoom. He completed the entire assignment as practice and showed a very nice calculator.
       Then we started from scratch to create a document together. I helped the team use .isinteger for the function. <br>

    3)Report  <br>
      Type typed it up. <br>
