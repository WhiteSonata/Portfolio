    1)Readings <br>
      How do I use the sandbox!? I asked my classmates and they didn't know either.

      Aha, I figured it out. So you need to click the + button and Browser.

    I think how they structured their example within Ch.4 was odd but maybe I need to read a different chapter to understand.
    

    2)Activity  <br>
       Austin created the document and we went over it using Zoom. He completed the entire assignment as practice and showed a very nice calculator.
       Then we started from scratch to create a document together. I helped the team use .isinteger for the function. 

    3)Report  <br>
      Type typed it up.
