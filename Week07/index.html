    <b> Week 07 </b> <br>

    1)Readings <br>
    The reading is missing information on recursive functions. It is best practice to avoid using recursive functions as it takes up more memory.     <br>
    <br>
    Async is great in Android Studio too~! <br>
    
    ...Why did the readings have absolutely nothing to do with the activity? <br>
      
    2)Activity  <br>
    This activity was not as successful as usual but I am grateful to have the group mates that I do. <br>
    
    3)Report  <br>
    Overall a tiring week. <br>
