    <b> Week 04</b> <br>

    1)Readings <br>
      
      
    2)Activity  <br>
      Sadly, I was late to the group meeting since I confused the time zones. Nope I am not Pacific Time anymore. <br> 
      I needed to be on my laptop for the meeting but my eldest son was in his speech therapy course online.      <br>
      Thus I was stuck on my phone, I did my best to contribute to the group while multitasking.                  <br>
    
    3)Report  <br>
