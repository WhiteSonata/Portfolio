    <b> Week 08 </b> <br>

    1)Readings <br>
   Love the short hand version of transition: trasform but I wish it would properly explain which attributes need <br>
   to be where in order to function. <br>
   
   Not seeing how or when I would use the Canvas features.<br>
   
    
    ...Why did the readings have absolutely nothing to do with the activity? <br>
      
    2)Activity  <br>
    This activity was not as successful as usual but I am grateful to have the group mates that I do. <br>
    
    Here is the activity: <a href="Week08/javascript30-drums.zip">Group Work Zip file</a>
    
    3)Report  <br>
   I am personnally behind on most if not all my courses. I got a job expecting 10 - 20 hours a week until the summer time but <br>
   my first week a full time employee no call no showed causing my hours to go up to 30ish. I would have continued getting more <br>
   hours than I wanted if I didn't put in my two weeks. <br>
