    <b> Week 05</b> <br>

    1)Readings <br>
    I read Chapter 10 on Testing and Debugging in SitePoint. Ugh I wish I had two screens for this part! <br>
    When would I use a stack trace? I feel typically browser inspectors and other IDEs do this on their own. <br>
    Are there Asserts in JS? <br>
    
      
    2)Activity  <br>

    This activity was successful and I am grateful to have the group mates that I do. <br>
    
    3)Report  <br>
    Overall a good week. <br>
