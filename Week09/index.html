    <b> Week 09 </b> <br>

    1)Readings <br>
    Document writing is super helpful! However for now I do not see how manipulating Window is useful for Browsers <br>
    ;maybe on mobile screens? <br>
    When are cookies needed? I do not understand why things should be saved on the users computer instead of the server. <br>
      
    2)Activity  <br>
    Oops I accidently put this weeks Activity code in last weeks since I am smidge behind. My bad. >.<
   
    3)Report  <br>
    Downing in work and children as per usual. I really wish the reading was more  directly relatable to the activities.<br>
    I still feel like the activities and the readings on two seperate classes. Don't get me wrong I do believe they are both <br>
    helpful in their own way. The book would certainly be a more intensive course if the exercises were modeled after them.
